This program receives a character from the standard input, and writes the input character back to the standard output, followed by a newline character

;;;;;;;;;++        store the integer 2 in BLOCK_IMPL1
;+                 store the integer 1 in BLOCK_IMPL2

                   the + operator when applied to BLOCK_IMPL1 and BLOCK_IMPL2 produces implementation-defined results
                   in this case, when BLOCK_IMPL1 has the value 2 and BLOCK_IMPL2 has the value 1, a character from stdin is read, which is then stored in BLOCK_OPERAND1

                   BLOCK_IMPL1 and BLOCK_IMPL2 are now imlpicitly set to 0

;;;;;;;;;;+        set BLOCK_IMPL1 to 1
;+                 set BLOCK_IMPL2 to 1
                   this writes the value stored in BLOCK_OPERAND1 to stdout

                   we'll consider that this implementation defines an environment that uses the usual ASCII codes to represent the characters in its character set
                   this means that the newline character can be represented by the integer 10

;;;;;+             apply the + operator on BLOCK_ZERO to set BLOCK_OPERAND1 to 0
;;;;;;;++++++++++  set BLOCK_OPERAND1 to 10
;;;;;;;;;+         set BLOCK_IMPL1 to 1
;+                 set BLOCK_IMPL2 to 1
                   this will write a newline character to stdout
